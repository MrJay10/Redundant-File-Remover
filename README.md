# Redundant-File-Remover
Python code to remove duplicate files from a directory/folder

It just happened that I downloaded a torrent of 425 pdf e-books (no seriously) and it turned out there were 
lots of duplicate files. They all started with a 6-digit string which was common and then followed by some hex code 
different for each file. So windows couldn't detect the duplicacy.

So instead of removing all those duplicates and giving a load on my down arrow key and delete key, 
I thought it'd be better to just code it out.

So by just using Python and os module, I was done in 9 LOC.
